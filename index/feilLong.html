            <p> Fei Long developed his own form of martial art called Hitenryu Kung Fu. While fighting on the streets to sharpen his skills, he was noticed by a movie director and soon became an international sensation, appearing in a string of action movies. <br><br>After he became famous, he was noticed by the criminal organization Shadaloo, which tried to forcibly recruit him, but he refused. After the second Street Fighter tournament, Fei Long decided that he preferred the real thing to the staged, choreographed fight scenes in movies, and gave up his movie career. <br><br>Fei Long's design is modeled after the late martial arts legend, Bruce Lee. </p>
