            <p>Originally a "Shadaloo Doll," Cammy was once controlled by Shadaloo using M. Bison's DNA. In the timeline of Street Fighter Alpha 3, Cammy is sent to assassinate Dhalsim. Instead, Dhalsim uses his spiritual powers to make her self-aware, causing her to finally realize that Shadaloo was controlling her. <br><br> Suspecting he was losing his control over Cammy, Bison sends Vega to observe her. When Vega confronts her, he tells her she was an "experiment" and was no longer needed and attacks her, but Cammy defeats him. </p>
