            <p>Zangief is a Russian wrestler known as "The Red Cyclone". He impressed the president of the (then) USSR, Gorbachev, so much that he was hired by the government and soon became a national hero. <br><br>Under orders from Gorbachev, Zangief was sent to combat the forces of Shadaloo, which is beginning to spread its corruption into Russia. Zangief encountered many fighters along the way, and ended up befriending a few of them, such as E. Honda and R. Mika. </p>
