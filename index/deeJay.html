            <p>Dee Jay is a Jamaican kickboxer who fights with musical rhythm and is known as the "Southern Comet". During the events of Street Fighter Alpha 3, he anonymously challenged and defeated Adon, who uses rival kickboxing style Muay Thai. <br><br> After defeating him, Dee Jay set his sights on The God of Muay Thai, Sagat. Sagat, now a Shadaloo enforcer for M. Bison, didn't take the cheerful Jamaican seriously. Dee Jay managed to defeat Sagat, adding to Sagat's losing streak at the time. <br><br>After Dee Jay's victory over Sagat, M. Bison took an interest in him and offered him a position in Shadaloo, but Dee Jay refused. After the tournament, Dee Jay returned to Jamaica and created some new music that was inspired from his earlier battles. <br><br>His new tunes caught the ear of a record producer, who eventually offered Dee Jay a record deal. </p>
