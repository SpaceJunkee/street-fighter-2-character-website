            <p>Thunder Hawk is the greatest warrior of the proud Thunderfoot tribe which lives in Mexico near the Monte Albán plains. When he was an infant, the Thunderfoot tribe were being forced off their land by Shadaloo. <br><br> Some of the tribe members resisted and fought against Shadaloo, but many were killed. T. Hawk's father, Arroyo Hawk, was also killed by M. Bison. <br><br>After learning about Shadaloo, T. Hawk vowed revenge on Bison for his actions and to reclaim the land that was taken from his people. Many tribe members also went missing, and T. Hawk took the responsibility of finding them. </p>
