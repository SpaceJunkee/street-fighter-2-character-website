            <p>Vega was born to a privileged noble family. For reasons unknown, his family status dwindled, causing Vega's beautiful mother to remarry for financial security. <br><br>He didn't like his step-father and thought he was ugly. As Vega matured, he studied bull fighting and later went to Japan to study his other passion, Ninjutsu, a style he believed would mesh well with his natural grace and agility. <br><br>Combining bullfighting and Ninjutsu, Vega felt his fighting abilities were complete and joined an underground cage fighting circuit. He quickly became one of the best. </p>
