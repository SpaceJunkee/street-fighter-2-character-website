            <p> When Guile was a trainee in the United States Air Force, he became good friends with his superior officer, Charlie Nash. <br><br>Guile requested that Charlie teach him his unique form of fighting, and Charlie agreed to do so. Guile learned Charlie's fighting style, but his loose temper held him back from mastering the art. <br><br>Guile is sent by the U.S. Air Force to investigate the disappearance of Charlie, who went missing during a secret investigation. During his search, he meets Interpol investigator Chun-Li, who urges him to stop looking for Charlie due to the danger involved. <br><br>Guile, confident in his fighting ability, reassures Chun Li that he will not back down.</p>
